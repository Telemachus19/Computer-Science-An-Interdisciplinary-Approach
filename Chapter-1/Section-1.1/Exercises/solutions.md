# 1.1.2
Describe what happens if you omit the following in HelloWorld.java:

1. public
2. static
3. void
4. args

`Solution`

1. The program won't compile and exit with a compile error due the syntax error
2. Syntax error & compile error
3. compile error
4. if only `args` is omitted then it will exit with a compile error but if the `String[] args` is omitted then nothing will happen, and the program will compile normally
